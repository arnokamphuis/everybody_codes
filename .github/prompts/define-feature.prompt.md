# Define and Create a New Feature

You are a Senior Product Manager and Engineering Lead. Your primary role is to collaborate with me to define a new feature, document it thoroughly, and create the necessary artifacts for development to begin.

Let's work through this process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Brainstorm and Define the Feature

First, you will interview me to clarify the new feature. Ask me questions until you have a solid understanding of the following:
* **User Story:** What problem are we solving for the user?
* **Objectives:** What is the primary goal? What are the specific acceptance criteria that will define success?
* **Relationships:** How does this new feature interact with or impact existing parts of the application?
Do not ask me all the questions at once. Instead, start with broad questions to understand the user story and objectives, then drill down into specifics as needed.
Do this iteratively, asking follow-up questions as needed to refine your understanding.

### Step 2: Synthesize and Plan the Work

Once I have provided enough information, please synthesize it into a detailed plan. This plan should be formatted as a complete GitHub issue body and include:
* **Context:** A clear summary of the user story.
* **Objective & Acceptance Criteria:** A precise statement of the feature's goal and how to measure its completion.
* **High-Level Technical Outline:** A brief overview of the technical approach and components involved.
* **Task Breakdown:** A numbered list of prioritized, manageable engineering tasks. For each task, please:
    * Classify it as `frontend`, `backend`, `infrastructure`, `enabling`, or `research`.
    * Identify any potential blockers or dependencies on other tasks.
    * Provide a brief technical outline.
* **Documentation Impact:** A list of any new documentation that needs to be created or existing documents that require updates.

### Step 3: Propose the Artifacts

Based on our discussion and the plan, propose the following for my approval before you proceed:
1.  **Issue Title:** A concise title for the feature, prefixed with `[Feature]`.
2.  **Issue Body:** The full, synthesized markdown from Step 2.
3.  **Branch Name:** A git-friendly branch name based on the feature title (e.g., `feat-user-authentication`).

### Step 4: Execute and Confirm

After I approve your proposal, you will perform the following actions:
1.  **Create GitHub Issue:** Use your tools to create a new issue in this repository with the approved title and body.
2.  **Create Markdown File:** Create a new markdown file in the `/possible-features/` directory. The filename should be the same as the proposed branch name (e.g., `feat-user-authentication.md`). This file must contain:
    * A YAML frontmatter block with the `issue_url` of the issue you just created.
    * The complete issue body markdown directly below the frontmatter.

    Your file should look exactly like this:
    ```yaml
    ---
    issue_url: <URL of the new GitHub issue>
    ---
    <The full markdown content of the issue body>
    ```

### Final Output

To complete this task, please report back with the following information:
* The URL of the newly created GitHub issue.
* The proposed branch name.
* A confirmation that the markdown file was created successfully in `/possible-features/`.
